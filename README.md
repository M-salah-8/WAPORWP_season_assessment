# Agricultural Monitoring with WaPOR (Seasonal & Monthly Analysis)
This monitoring system analyzes data on a seasonal and monthly basis, generating ready-to-use results (maps and charts), and data for further analysis (GeoJSON, TIFs, datasheets).\
Built Based on [Standardized protocol for land and water productivity analyses using WaPOR](https://github.com/wateraccounting/WAPORWP) code.

### What the code does:
* Download WaPOR data.
* Convert dakedal data to seasonal and monthly data.
* Calclate Irrigation performance indicators.
	- uniformity.
	- efficiency (beneficial fraction).
	- adquacy.
	- relative water deficit.
* Calculate land and water productivity.
	- land -> biomass and crop yield.
	- water -> biomass water productivity and crop water productivity.
* Identify bright (good performing) spots.
* Calculate productivity gaps

### Exporting formats
* tifs.
* Spreadsheets.
* maps.
* charts.
* Vectores (geojson).\
